From the salt curing process, the salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./salty_egg.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Chinese Salty Egg\\\"></p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 428 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t// empty (null-loader)\n\n/***/ },\n/* 429 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"My Second Post!\",\"date\":\"2015-05-06T23:46:37.121Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"readNext\":\"/hi-folks/\",\"path\":\"/my-second-post/\",\"body\":\"<p>Wow!

From the salt curing process, the salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./salty_egg.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Chinese Salty Egg\\\"></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2015-05-01-hello-world/index.md\n ** module id = 427\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"My Second Post!\",\"date\":\"2015-05-06T23:46:37.121Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"readNext\":\"/hi-folks/\",\"path\":\"/my-second-post/\",\"body\":\"<p>Wow!
